# Development Log: WSS Security Enhancement Attempt & Rollback

**Date:** 2025-07-15  
**Session:** 03  
**Developer:** Claude (AI Assistant)  
**Issue Type:** Security Enhancement  
**Status:** Failed & Rolled Back

## Project Overview

Attempted a comprehensive implementation of WSS (WebSocket Secure) encryption for the ensemble mode real-time collaboration feature. The goal was to secure communication between Conductor and Performer devices. However, the implementation failed during testing due to platform-specific certificate compatibility issues. As a result, the implementation was rolled back to standard WebSockets (WS) to maintain core functionality.

This log documents the attempted implementation and the reasons for the rollback.

## Security Requirements Analysis

### Threat Model
- **Target:** Local network WebSocket communication
- **Threats:** Eavesdropping, MITM attacks, packet injection
- **Attempted Solution:** TLS encryption with certificate pinning

## Implementation Attempt Details

### 1. Network Security Configuration
**File:** `app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`

**Attempted Changes:**
```xml
<!-- Attempted to enforce WSS with certificate pinning -->
<base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
    <trust-anchors>
        <certificates src="@raw/scoremate_cert" />
        <certificates src="system" />
    </trust-anchors>
</base-config>
```
**Result:** This configuration blocked the fallback to WS after WSS failed.

### 2. SSL Server Implementation
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/mrgq/pdfviewer/SimpleWebSocketServer.kt`

**Key Attempted Changes:**
The server was modified to create an `SSLServerSocket` using a PKCS12 keystore loaded from Android resources. It was configured to use TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.

**Encountered Error:** `java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException` when loading the PKCS12 keystore, indicating an incompatibility between the keytool-generated certificate and Android's BouncyCastle provider.

### 3. Final State (Rollback)
- **Protocol:** Reverted from `wss://` back to `ws://`.
- **Network Security:** The `network_security_config.xml` was configured to permit cleartext traffic to allow WS to function.
- **Code:** All SSL-related code in `SimpleWebSocketServer`, `CollaborationServerManager`, and `CollaborationClientManager` was disabled.

## Security Benefits Attempted (Not Achieved)

- **Encryption:** Goal was to encrypt all ensemble traffic with TLS.
- **Authentication:** Goal was to use certificate pinning to prevent impersonation.
- **Integrity:** Goal was to use TLS to prevent packet modification.

## Testing Strategy & Failure Point

The implementation failed during the initial functionality test.
1.  **Basic Connection:** The WSS connection failed to establish.
2.  **Root Cause:** `SSLHandshakeException` on the client side, caused by the `NoSuchAlgorithmException` on the server side when loading the keystore.

## Future Enhancements

The WSS implementation remains a high-priority future task. The detailed failure analysis in `WSS_IMPLEMENTATION_ATTEMPTS.md` will serve as a guide for the next attempt. Key areas to investigate are:
- Generating certificates using different tools or libraries (e.g., BouncyCastle programmatically).
- Using alternative keystore formats like `BKS`.
- Exploring different SSL providers like Conscrypt.

## Notes

This log has been updated to reflect the final status of this development session. The initial report of success was premature and based on implementation without full testing. The key takeaway is the critical importance of addressing platform-specific cryptographic library compatibility.

## Status

- **Implementation:** Rolled Back 롤
- **Testing:** Failed ❌
- **Documentation:** Updated to reflect failure ✅
- **Security Review:** Not applicable, as feature is disabled.
